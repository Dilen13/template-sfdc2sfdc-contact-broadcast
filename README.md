# Use Case <a name="usecase"/>
As a Salesforce admin I want to syncronize contacts between two Salesfoce orgs.

This Kick (template) should serve as a foundation for setting an online sync of Contacts from one SalesForce instance to another. Everytime there is a new Contact or a change in an already existing one, SFDC Streaming API will notify this integration that will be responsible for updating the Contact on the target org.

Requirements have been set not only to be used as examples, but also to stablish starting point to adapt your integration to your requirements.

# Run it!

On either environment (CloudHub or On Premise) this Kick is configured to filter Contacts with a certain criteria that should be used as an example to build your own. 
In this case, Contacts will be synced from origin instance only if they have an Email set and the Mailing Country is either "United States", "US" or "U.S.". All this are set in the Query so the filtering is done on SalesForce side lowering the load of data transfered to the integration, in order to make it more efficient.



## Running on CloudHub <a name="runoncloudhub"/>

While [creating your application on CloudHub](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Hello+World+on+CloudHub) (Or you can do it later as a next step), you need to go to Deployment > Advanced to set all environment variables detailed in **Properties to be configured** as well as the **mule.env**. 

Once your app is all set and started, there is no need to do anything else. Every time a Contact is created or modified, it will be automatically synchronised to SFDC Org B as long as it has an Email.


## Running on premise <a name="runonopremise"/>
Complete all properties in one of the property files, for example in [mule.prod.properties] (../blob/master/src/main/resources/mule.prod.properties) and run your app with the corresponding environment variable to use it. To follow the example, this will be `mule.env=prod`.

Once your app is all set and started, there is no need to do anything else. Every time a Contact is created or modified, it will be automatically synchronised to SFDC Org B as long as it has an Email.


## Properties to be configured (With examples) <a name="propertiestobeconfigured"/>

In order to use this Mule Kick you need to configure properties (Credentials, configurations, etc.) either in properties file or in CloudHub as Environment Variables. Detail list with examples:

### Application configuration
+ polling.frequency  
+ watermark.default.expression

#### SalesForce Connector configuration for company A
+ sfdc.a.username `bob.dylan@orga`
+ sfdc.a.password `DylanPassword123`
+ sfdc.a.securityToken `avsfwCUl7apQs56Xq2AKi3X`
+ sfdc.a.url `https://login.salesforce.com/services/Soap/u/26.0`

#### SalesForce Connector configuration for company B
+ sfdc.b.username `joan.baez@orgb`
+ sfdc.b.password `JoanBaez456`
+ sfdc.b.securityToken `ces56arl7apQs56XTddf34X`
+ sfdc.b.url `https://login.salesforce.com/services/Soap/u/26.0`



# Customize It!<a name="customizeit"/>

This brief guide intends to give a high level idea of how this Kick is built and how you can change it according to your needs.
As mule applications are based on XML files, this page will be organized by describing all the XML that conform the Kick.
Of course more files will be found such as Test Classes and [Mule Application Files](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Application+Format), but to keep it simple we will focus on the XMLs.

Here is a list of the main XML files you'll find in this application:

* [config.xml](#configxml)
* [businessLogic.xml](#businesslogicxml)
* [errorHandling.xml](#errorhandlingxml)


## config.xml<a name="configxml"/>
Configuration for Connectors and [Properties Place Holders](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Configuring+Properties) are set in this file. **Even you can change the configuration here, all parameters that can be modified here are in properties file, and this is the recommended place to do it so.** Of course if you want to do core changes to the logic you will probably need to modify this file.

In the visual editor they can be found on the *Global Element* tab.


## businessLogic.xml<a name="businesslogicxml"/>
TBD


## errorHandling.xml<a name="errorhandlingxml"/>
Contains a [Catch Exception Strategy](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Catch+Exception+Strategy) that is only Logging the exception thrown (If so). As you imagine, this is the right place to handle how your integration will react depending on the different exceptions.
